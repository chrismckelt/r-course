## What is this application?

This ShinyApp built with R will contract variables in the Lending Clubs loan book with the total loan amount.

[https://chrismckelt.shinyapps.io/data-products-1/](https://chrismckelt.shinyapps.io/data-products-1/)</br>

Comparisions against credit grade, zip code, homeownership and interest rate give insight into the quality of the book.

### How to use

## Overview of the Lending Club dataset

[Data source](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data)

The data contains all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information.

The file containing loan data through the "present" contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the previous completed calendar quarter. Additional features include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes, and state, and collections among others. 

The file is a matrix of about 890 thousand observations and 75 variables. A data dictionary is provided in a separate file.
